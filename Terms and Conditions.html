  </div> 
  <div class="card"> 
   <p> Welcome to Facebook!</p> 
   <p>Facebook builds technologies and services that enable people to connect with each other, build communities and grow businesses. These Terms govern your use of Facebook, Messenger and the other products, features, apps, services, technologies and software that we offer (the Facebook Products or Products), except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply. These Products are provided to you by Facebook, Inc.</p> 
   <p> We don't charge you to use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms. Instead, businesses and organisations pay us to show you ads for their products and services. By using our Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we think will be relevant to you and your interests. We use your personal data to help determine which ads to show you. </p> 
   <p>We dont sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don't share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission. Instead, advertisers can tell us things such as the kind of audience that they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to people who may be interested. We provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads that help them understand how people are interacting with their content. See Section 2 below to learn more. </p> 
   <p>Our Data Policy explains how we collect and use your personal data to determine some of the ads you see and provide all of the other services described below. You can also go to your settings at any time to review the privacy choices you have about how we use your data.</p> 
   <div class="question1">
     1. The services we provide 
   </div> Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide the products and services described below to you: 
   <div class="question">
     Provide a personalised experience for you: 
   </div> Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories, events, ads and other content that you see in News Feed or our video platform to the Pages that you follow and other features that you might use, such as Trending, Marketplace and search. We use the data that we have – for example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products – to personalise your experience. 
   <div class="question">
     Connect you with people and organisations that you care about: 
   </div> We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that matter to you across the Facebook Products that you use. We use the data that we have to make suggestions for you and others – for example, groups to join, events to attend, Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch and people who you may want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe that our services are most useful when people are connected to people, groups and organisations that they care about. 
   <div class="question">
     Help you discover content, products and services that may interest you: 
   </div> We show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content to help you discover content, products, and services that are offered by the many businesses and organisations that use Facebook and other Facebook Products. Section 2 below explains this in more detail. 
   <div class="question1">
     2. How our services are funded 
   </div> Instead of paying to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using the Facebook Products covered by these Terms, you agree that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Facebook Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you. Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our ad system. This means that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal, and the kind of audience that they want to see their ads (for example, people between the ages of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad to people who might be interested. We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Facebook. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Facebook ads work here. We collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services described above for you. You can learn about how we collect and use your data in our Data Policy. You have controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we use to determine which ads we show you. Learn more. 
   <div class="question1">
     3. Your commitments to Facebook and our community 
   </div>We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments: 
   <div class="question">
     Who can use Facebook 
   </div> When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is safer and more accountable. For this reason, you must: use the same name that you use in everyday life; provide accurate information about yourself; create only one account (your own) and use your timeline for personal purposes; and not share your password, give access to your Facebook account to others or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission). We try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use Facebook if: You are under 13 years old (or the minimum legal age in your country to use our Products). You are a convicted sex offender. We've previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms or Policies. You are prohibited from receiving our products, services or software under applicable laws. 
   <div class="question">
     What you can share and do on Facebook 
   </div> We want people to use Facebook to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so): You may not use our Products to do or share anything: That breaches these Terms, our Community Standards, and other Terms and Policies that apply to your use of Facebook. That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent. That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights. You may not upload viruses or malicious code, or do anything that could disable, overburden or impair the proper working or appearance of our Products. You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data that you do not have permission to access. We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these provisions. If we remove content that you have shared in violation of our Community Standards, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property rights) or our terms and policies. We also can remove or restrict access to your content, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Facebook.
